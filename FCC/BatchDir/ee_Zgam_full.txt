! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run.
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive  -  but spellings-sensitive!
! The settings here are illustrative, not always physics-motivated.

! 1) Settings used in the main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 1000         ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 3          ! how many aborts before run stops

! 2) Settings related to output in init(), next() and stat().
Init:showChangedSettings = on      ! list changed settings
Init:showChangedParticleData = off ! list changed particle data
Next:numberCount = 100             ! print message every n events
Next:numberShowInfo = 1            ! print event information n times
Next:numberShowProcess = 1         ! print process record n times
Next:numberShowEvent = 0           ! print event record n times

Random:setSeed = on
Random:seed = 0	                   ! Batch script should overwrite this
				   ! to get different seeds for subsamples 

! 3) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 11                   ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = -11                   ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212

Beams:allowMomentumSpread = off
Beams:sigmaPzA = 0.144
Beams:sigmaPzB = 0.144

! 4) Hard process : ZH, Z->all modes, H->gamgam, at 240 GeV

Beams:eCM = 240.                 ! CM energy of collision

WeakZ0:gmZmode = 2
WeakBosonAndParton:ffbar2gmZgm = on
23:onMode = on
