# Inspect the file ee_ZH_Z_Hbb
# What centre-of-mass energy do we use?
# What decay modes do we select for Z and H?

# Let's generate some events!
python generate.py

# Inspect the .root output file
# Try to understand its contents.

# Copy the actual analysis code
cp ../heppy/test/analysis_ee_ZH_had_cfg.py .

# Run the analysis code on the first 1000 events
heppy OutDir analysis_ee_ZH_cfg.py -N 1000

# Inspect the output file
# Try to understand its contents.

# Now we need to switch to Higgs decays to two photons
# Create new file ee_ZH_Z_Hgamgam.txt in which the Higgs is forced to decay to photons.

# Generate events as before!

# How do you need to modify the analysis code to select this new signal process?
